### Intro to Data Science Portfolio

In Fall 2019, I had the opportunity to take CSCI 385 or Intro to Data Science. The class was formatted to where we had a year long portfolio split into three seperate deliverables. The three deliverables were split into three sections of the Data Science Life Cycle:

(1) Data Prep
(2) Model Building
(3) Results & Operationalization

This is a link to my project, which I decided to do on App store analytics and app ratings.
